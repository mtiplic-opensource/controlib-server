What is it?

controlib-server is a JAVA library allowing developpers to connect Android
devices with applications using controlib-client. It decodes messages sent with
the device in order data can be used by jar plugins.
Main goal is to control your computer, whatever is the OS, with your Android
phone and let the developpers build specific remotes according to their needs.

For the moment, the project has just begun and has not been released yet.
